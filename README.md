## Board Game League

[Board Game League](https://boardgameleague.io)

A not so small project for playing and running a board game league, which is primarily used for keeping track of a larger league hosted by a board game shop. There is functionality though for just keeping track of games played with friends you often play with, so you can keep track of stats, performance, and achievements.

## Twilight Imperium Map Generator

[TI4 PoK Map Generator](https://keeganw.github.io/ti4/)

Do you play Twilight Imperium, but
1. Want to have setup completed ahead of time?
2. Don't like the randomness of the initial draft?
3. Want to design fun and intriguing maps?

If you answered yes to any of the above, give this tool a try! More information on the landing page.


## Pick Player

[Pick Player](https://keeganw.github.io/pick-player)

A replacement for [Chwasi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tendadigital.chwaziApp), or any other "pick a person out of a group" solution. Use this tool to do it in a more interesting way, and maybe learn something new about a friend!

## Party Scoring

[Party Scoring](https://keeganw.github.io/party-scoring/)

A throw away app which was created to help keep track of tasks at a party with friends. In the future, can easily be expanded to be more dynamic.
